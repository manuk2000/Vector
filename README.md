# Vector
Implement Java Vector
This is an implementation of a Vector class in Java. It supports dynamic resizing, indexing, adding, removing, and iterating over elements.

#Usage
To use this Vector class, simply include the file in your project and create a new instance of the Vector class with a specified capacity.
You can also create a new Vector from an existing collection.

#Implementation Details
The Vector class is implemented using an array of objects.
The initial capacity is set when the Vector is created and the capacity is increased as needed when new elements are added to the Vector.

The class provides various methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements, as well as methods for iterating over the elements in the Vector.
It also provides an implementation of the Enumeration interface for backwards compatibility.
